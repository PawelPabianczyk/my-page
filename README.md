## About The Project
MyPage is a web design project, which helped me expand my knowledge about HTML and CSS. The major goal of coding this app was to get to know these technologies better. Also I wanted to create my own page about interests and projects. In the future I will be adding new informations and new features to this web, because it is a pleasant change from backend and database environment.<br/>[Here you can check the result of my work](https://pawelpabianczyk.github.io/my-page/).
